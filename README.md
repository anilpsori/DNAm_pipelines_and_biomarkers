## DNAm_pipelines_and_biomarkers

In this repository you will find R code for the 101 DNA methylation data processing and normalization pipelines described in Ori et al., 2021. See the "function_runPipelines.R" script in the pipeline directory for an R function that contains code for all the 101 pipelines and furthermore allows you to run your choice of analytical pipeline.

In the "biomarker" directory you can also find R scripts to get estimates for DNAm predictors that are described in the manuscript. I could not make code for all predictors available because of proprietary licences for some algorithms but the vast majority of predictors you can find there.
